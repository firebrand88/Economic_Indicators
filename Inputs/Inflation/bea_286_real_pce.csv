"Legend / Footnotes:"
"1. Food consists of food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption; food services, which include purchased meals and beverages, are not classified as food."
"2. Consists of gasoline and other energy goods and of electricity and gas services."
"3. Market-based PCE is a supplemental measure that is based on household expenditures for which there are observable price measures. It excludes most imputed transactions (for example, financial services furnished without payment) and the final consumption expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households."
"Note. Chained (2012) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2012 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive."
